                    This was definitely one of the more frustrating models to figure out as the intructions did not specify how to interlock the cubes, only how 
                    to make each piece. This did make it super satisfying to finish though!`

                    it could look pretty cool if I made a rainbow pattern out of them and so I did!`

                    wearing off, so his time to go is unfortunately creeping closer, that is, until I decide to replace the tape.`

        description: `This is my most proud piece: The origami torus. This model took me about 2-3 months to complete. A majority of the time was spent 
                    making the PhiZZ units, which I would make while binge watching shows. At certain points I even got hand cramps from just folding them. 
                    The process of actually putting the pieces together was much more fun; it was like legos in a sense. All in all I am very satisfied with how it came out. 
                    I think the rainbow color scheme is pretty sick!`
